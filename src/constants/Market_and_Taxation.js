    <div className="Introduction">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        I remember a time (maybe about 10 years ago) I had the opportunity to meet one of
        those hard to find Chartered Accountants who knew both taxation and markets quite well.
         It was at a friend’s party that I got introduced to him. He asked me what I do for a
         living, to which I promptly replied that I trade for a living. We immediately struck a
         chord and had a great conversation going.
        </p>
        <p>
        I was an eager learner, as I spent all my time learning about the markets and trading
        strategies but spent very little time learning about taxation and its relevance to market participants.
        Probably the reason why I consciously ignored learning about taxation was that I always feared the heavy
        usage of jargon, random references to sections, subsections, circulars, and whatnot. To my defense – I
        once did honestly try to learn about taxation. I paid a visit to my broker’s office and met my dealer
        and  questioned him on taxation. This is what he had to say – “Arre, why are you so worried? Long-term
        capital  tax is 0% and short-term capital gains tax is 15%, that’s it, it is a simple matter.”
        I for sure knew it was not just that, I insisted to meet someone more knowledgeable to understand the topic
        in greater detail. To my luck I got to meet the Regional Head of the stockbroking company, enthusiastically
        I picked his brains about taxation for market participants; unfortunately even he reiterated the same thing
        that my dealer had told me. It seemed even worse as the regional manager had a sense of pride while he gave
        me that sloppy answer.Frustrated, I visited a CA and he essentially said the same thing that my dealer said
        but he used fancy jargon and complicated the whole matter to no end. At that point in time, nobody had
        blogged about it online, no good articles were written on the topic, and thus my quest to learn taxation
        related to markets got squashed like a bug.In retrospect, had I known more about this topic, had I got
        more information – I would have clearly benefited in multiple ways.
        I’m certain there are many traders and investors in a similar situation as I was many years ago.
        In fact, this is true considering that our blog on taxation (which was put up a few years ago)
         has received over 10000 questions! This number is beside the numerous emails received and queries
          asked on Trading Q&A.
        </p>
        <p>
        Lastly, if I look back in time, I could not imagine brokers giving out such valuable information to clients.
         In fact, stockbrokers were always known to hoard information and pass it only to select clients.
         I’m sure you would agree with me on this, especially if you have been trading the Indian markets for a while now.
         Stock Brokers in India have always been snobby, expensive, and full of unwanted attitude.
        However, the stockbroking industry is slowly waking up to the fact that the customer, irrespective of his size deserves the best.
        </p>
        <p>
        So please do go ahead and explore this unique module on Markets & Taxation.
        I can assure you that the content presented here will make you more confident about matters related to taxation,
         and with that new-found confidence, you will never have to fear the taxman!

        <div className="Overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
            India needs help from all of us countrymen in developing a tax culture.
             The fear of the income tax department can be removed only by gaining knowledge
             of all the basic rules and regulations. Income tax rates in India have drastically reduced
            from over 90% in the early seventies to now (2020) where no tax has to be paid on annual income
            up to Rs 2.5lks. But the apathy of taxpayers towards filing income tax returns and paying taxes
            continues till today.With the systems used by the IT department becoming sophisticated every year,
            the chances of repercussions in terms of notices and penalties due to non-filing, misfiling,
            and hiding information while filing your income tax returns (ITR) is going up significantly.
            Similar to how Income-tax (IT) department has access to all your bank account details,
            they can also check up on all your capital market activity easily through the exchanges as they
            are all mapped to your PAN (Permanent account number). With AADHAR slowly getting linked everywhere
            the day isn’t far when the IT department will be able to send you a consolidated activity
            (income and expenses) statement, similar to how NSDL/CDSL sends for your holdings across all Demat accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
            Even if the intent is there to be compliant, most people including many Chartered Accountants (CAs)
            don’t understand the subject of taxation when investing & trading very well. We had put up a blog post,
            “Taxation Simplified” on Z-Connect many years back simplifying key aspects of taxation for market
            participants. We received a few thousand queries on that post. Answering all of them it was obvious
            that we had to do a lot more to simplify all aspects around taxation while trading or investing in
            the markets, hence this module.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you only invest in stocks or mutual funds filing returns is quite simple, but can get tricky if trading intraday stocks or financial derivatives (futures and options).

We will in this module break all the concepts down into small easy to understand chapters without any of that jargon typically used by CA’s or tax consultants. Here is a sneak peek into what you can expect going forward in this module –

        <div className="What is income tax ?">
            <p>
            It is a tax levied by the Government of India on the income of every person. The provisions governing the Income-tax Law are given in the Income-tax Act, 1961. In simpler words, Income Tax is a portion of the money that you earn paid to the government of India.
            </p>
            <h4>Why should I pay tax?</h4>
            <p>
            Yes, India does not offer social security and free medical facilities as being provided in some developed countries, but the government needs funds collected as taxes to discharge a number of responsibilities like Government hospitals, Education, National defense, Infrastructure development just to name a few.
            </p>
            <h5>Who is supposed to pay income tax?</h5>
            <p>
            Income-tax is to be paid by every person who earns more than the minimum income slab set by the government. The term ‘person’ as defined under the Income-tax Act covers in its ambit natural as well as artificial persons (including corporate).

Only 5 percent of over 130 crore population file income tax returns and only 1.5 crore Indians (<1%) pay any income tax. If you had to compare, over 45% of the population in a developed economy like the U.S.A pay taxes. Part of the reason for such an abysmally low number is also because many Indians don’t earn enough to qualify to pay income tax, but the larger factor has got to do with a lack of tax culture.

Taxes have to be paid based on how much income you earn every financial year. The financial year in India starts from April 1st and ends on 31st March. Do note that year can be specified either as a financial year (FY) or assessment Year (AY).

FY is used to denote the actual year the income was earned for which you are filing taxes. So FY 2019/20 is the financial year starting April 1st, 2019, and ending 31st March 2020.

AY is used to denote the year in which you are supposed to file your taxes. So AY 2020/21 is the year when you file the returns for income earned in FY 2019/20. So AY 2020/21 and FY 2019/20 are one and the same. So you will use ITR with AY 2020/21 on it to file your taxes for the income earned in the financial year starting April 1st, 2019, and ending 31st March 2020.

        <h2>Classifying Your Market Activity</h2>
        {/* topic-1 */}
        <div className="Are you a trader or investor or both?">
            <h3>Are you a trader or investor or both?</h3>
            <p>
            dentifying yourself as a trader or an investor is the first step to file your income tax returns.

This may seem like an easy task, but here is what this circular from CBDT (Central board of direct taxes) says:
“If you buy shares with the intent of earning income through dividends you are an investor, and if you buy and sell shares with the intent to profit, you are a trader”:).

Yes, that is how vague it is, and this is a circular dated 2007, released after 18 years of the original circular. Numerous judicial pronouncements and government were still unable to clear this highly debatable issue. Thanks to the vagueness of this circular, it has given too much power in the hands of the assessing Income tax officer (AO) especially considering the fact that most of the stock purchases are done intending to profit from the price appreciation.
            </p>
            <p>
            It now says that an individual can decide on his own to either show his stock investments as capital gains or as a business income (trading) irrespective of the period of holding the listed shares and securities. Whatever is the stance once taken, the taxpayer will have to continue with the same in the subsequent years.
            So before filing income tax returns, you will have to first classify yourself as an investor, trader, or both.  We will in this chapter help you figure this out in line with what most AO’s would be expecting. By income, I mean both profits and losses.
            When trading or investing you need to classify your income under one of these heads, broadly speaking they are –
            <ul>
                <li>Long term capital gain (LTCG)</li>
                <li>Short term capital gain (STCG)</li>
                <li>Speculative business income</li>
                <li>Non-speculative business income</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Long term capital gain (LTCG)</h5>
            <p>
            Assume you buy stocks or Mutual Funds today for Rs.50,000/- and sell the same after 365 days at Rs.55,000/-, then the profit or gain of Rs.5,000/- is considered as Long term capital gain. Generally speaking, gain or profit earned by investing in stocks or equity mutual funds, and selling after 1 year from date of purchase can be categorized under LTCG. Currently, in India any gains realized and categorized as LTCG (equity & equity MF) is completely exempt from taxes for the first Rs 1lk and at 10% if LTCG for the year exceeds Rs 1lk (from FY 2018/19). Do note – the purchase and sale of shares have to be conducted via a recognized exchange.

Until FY 2017/18 – if you had bought Infosys shares worth Rs.1,00,000/- 10 years ago, and sold the same today for Rs 1 crore, you don’t have to pay any taxes on your gain or profit of Rs 99,00,000. So, taxes on long term capital gain of Rs 99,00,000 = 0 (Zero) or would have been exempt.

Going forward, LTCG exceeding Rs 1lk will be taxed at 10%. To ensure that this tax is applied only from the date of announcement of this tax (Union Budget, Feb 1st, 2018), a grandfather clause was introduced – for all stocks held before Feb 1st, the acquisition cost for the purpose of computing capital gains will be the higher of the actual purchase price or the maximum traded price on Jan. 31.
            </p>
            <h5>Short term capital gain (STCG)</h5>
            <p>
            Assume you buy listed stocks or equity-oriented mutual funds today for Rs.50,000/- and sell the same within the period of 12 months, say at Rs.55,000/-, then the profit or gain of Rs.5,000/- is taxed as a Short term capital gain(STCG).

Generally speaking, gain or profit earned by investing in stocks or equity mutual funds holding for more than 1 day (also called delivery based) and selling them within 12 months from date of purchase can be categorized under STCG.

Currently, tax on STCG in India is flat 15% on the gain or profit from sale of shares or equity-oriented mutual funds.

Therefore, if you buy Infosys shares worth Rs 100,000/- today and sell the same 10 days later for Rs.120,000/-, then you are liable to pay 15% on Rs 20,000 (STCG) or Rs 3000/- as taxes.

So, tax on short term capital gain = flat 15% of the gain/profit (listed stocks).
            </p>
            <h5>Speculative business income</h5>
            <p>
            As per section 43(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, profits earned by trading equity or stocks for intraday or non-delivery is categorized under speculative business income. Currency trading is also considered as speculative since there is no STT (unless you are using currency derivatives to hedge).

There is no fixed rate like capital gains tax rate when you have a business income. If you have a business income, it has to be added to the rest of your other income and tax has to be paid as per the tax slab you fall in.

For example, assume for the financial year my profit from trading intraday stocks was Rs. 100,000/-, and my salary for the year was Rs.400,000/-. So my total income for the year is Rs 5,00,000, and I have to pay taxes on this as per my tax slab, Rs 25000 in this case as shown below.
            </p>
            <h5>Non – speculative Business income</h5>
            <p>
            ncome from trading futures & options on recognized exchanges (equity, commodity) is categorized under non-speculative business income as per section 43(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

As discussed earlier, business income has no fixed tax rate, you are required to add the non-speculative business income to all your other income, and pay taxes according to the slab applicable to you.
You would be wondering why trading equity intraday is considered ‘speculative’ but trading F&O is considered ‘non-speculative’?

When trading intraday there is no intention of taking delivery, and hence it is considered a speculative business. F&O is defined as non-speculative by the government, maybe as they can be used for hedging and also for taking/giving delivery of the underlying contract (even though currently equity and currency derivatives in India are all cash-settled, but by definition, they give rise to giving/taking delivery. Certain commodity F&O contracts like gold have delivery options to it).

        <div className=" Pros and cons of declaring trading as a business income">
            <h3> Pros and cons of declaring trading as a business income</h3>
            <p>
            Let us look at the bright side first; here is a list of advantages of declaring trading as a business income
            <h4>Low Tax</h4>
            <p>
            If the total income (trading + any other) is less than Rs.250,000/-, then there is no tax implication, and now even if less than Rs.500,000/- effectively one has to pay zero tax as you can avail a rebate if total income less than Rs 5lks.
            </p>
            <h4>claim expense</h4>
            <p>
            One can claim the benefit of all expenses incurred for the business of trading (while for capital gains only charges on your contract note other than STT can be claimed). For example, brokerage charges, STT, other statutory taxes while trading, internet, phone, newspapers, depreciation of computers and electronics, research reports, books, advisory, etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Offset the loss with gains </h4>
            <p>
            – If one incurs any non-speculative F&O trading loss, this can be set-off against any income other than salary. For example, if I incur Rs 5,00,000 loss in trading F&O and my other income (like rent & interest, excluding salary) is Rs 10,00,000, I will have to pay tax only on Rs 5,00,000.
            </p>
            <h4>Carry forward the F&O loss</h4>
            <p>
            If there is net loss any year (non-speculative F&O + any income other than salary), and if income tax returns are filed before the due date, the loss can be carried forward for the next 8 years. During the next 8 years, this loss can be set-off against any other business gain (non-speculative business income). For example, if you had net loss of Rs 5,00,000 this year trading F&O which was declared on time, you can carry forward this loss next year and assuming you made a profit of Rs 20,00,000 next year, you can set off the previous year’s Rs 5,00,000 loss and pay taxes only on Rs 15,00,000.
            </p>
            <h4>Carry forward your intraday equity loss</h4>
            <p>
            Any speculative or intraday equity trading loss can be set-off only against any other speculative gain (note: you cannot set-off intraday equity trading loss which is considered speculative with F&O trading which is considered non-speculative). Speculative losses can be carried forward for 4 years if the returns are filed on time. So assume an equity intraday trader makes a loss of Rs.100,000/- this year, he cannot offset this against any other business income. However, he can carry it forward to the next year (up to 4 years). Assume the next year he makes a profit of Rs.50,000/- by trading equity intraday, then, in that case, he can use the previous year’s Rs.100,000/- loss to offset the complete gains of this year (Rs.50,000). The balance loss of Rs.50,000/- can still be carried forward to the next 3 years. So do note, the partial offset of losses is possible.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
            Now, here is a set of drawbacks for declaring your business income –
            <ul>
                l<li>
                    <h5>Potentially high taxes</h5>
                    <p>If you fall under the 30% tax slab, you will effectively pay 30% of all your trading profits as taxes</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>ITR Forms </h5>
                    <p>– Declaring business income would mean having to use an ITR3 (ITR 4 until 2016) or ITR 4 (ITR 4S until 2016), which would mean needing help of a CA to file your IT returns. This can be an added effort and cost especially for those salaried people who might have been using the very easy ITR 1 or ITR 2 (we will discuss more on this topic in the chapter on ITR forms)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Audit</h5>
                    <p> Having to maintain the book of accounts which will need to be audited if your turnover goes above Rs 5 crore  (was Rs 2 crore until FY 19/20) for a year or if your profit is less than 6% of your turnover (we will discuss more on this topic in the chapter on Turnover)</p>
                </li>

            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        {/* topic -3 */}
        <div className="What are you? Trader, Investor, or Both?">
            <h3>What are you? Trader, Investor, or Both?</h3>
            <p>
            Coming back to our original discussion, according to CBDT

Investor: anyone who invests with the intention of earning through dividends

Trader: anyone who buys and sells with the intention of profiting from the price rise.

As an investor, you can claim all your delivery based equity gains/profit to be capital gains. But as a trader, it becomes your business income which has its own pros and cons as discussed above.

The rule is very clear with respect to F&O trading, and intraday equity trading. F&O trading has to be considered as a non-speculative business, and intraday equity as speculative business. So if you trade these instruments, you have to use ITR 3 for filing IT returns. So even if you are salaried, you have to compulsorily use ITR3 and declare this income (profit or loss) from trading as a business.

Unlike what most people think, losses also are recommended to be declared. Hiding trading activity on the exchange from the IT department could mean trouble, especially in case of any IT scrutiny (IT scrutiny is when the assessing income tax officer (AO) demands you to meet him and give an explanation on your IT returns). The chances of getting a call for scrutiny are higher when the IT department systems/algorithms pick up trading activity on your PAN, but the same not declared on your ITR.
</p>
<p>
For equity delivery based investments, if you are holding stocks for more than a year, you would have received some kind of dividend and even if you didn’t, you can show them all as investments and claim an exemption under the long term capital gain. If you are buying and selling stocks frequently (yes it is an open statement, but there is no rule which quantifies ‘frequent’) for shorter terms, it is best to declare that as non-speculative business income instead of STCG.

Another thing to keep in mind is that if investing/trading on the markets is your only source of income, and even if your trading activity is moderate, it is best to classify income from all your equity trades as a business income instead of capital gains. On the other hand, if you are salaried or have some other business as your primary source of business, it becomes easier to show your equity trades as capital gains even if the frequency is slightly higher.

Thankfully one thing that the circular clarified was that you can be a trader and investor both at the same time. So you can have stocks meant as an investment for the long term, and stocks meant for shorter-term trades. Just because you indulge in a lot of shorter-term trades, wouldn’t necessarily convert all your long term holdings or investments into trades and therefore bring those long term gains under business income. But it is important to clearly demarcate your trading and investment portfolio while filing returns.

Similarly, if you are trading F&O or intraday equity trading, you compulsorily have to classify yourself as a trader, but you can still show your long term investments under the capital gains head to get the benefit of LTCG being exempt from taxes.

So, you can be an investor, trader, or both, but make sure to keep the above points in mind, and do consult a chartered accountant before filing returns.

Even though this might seem confusing, rules are made for 1% of the population that is trying to break them. As long as your intent is right, you know the basic concerns of the IT department and keep those in mind while filing IT returns, it is quite simple. But stay consistent with the way you classify yourself, don’t keep switching between being an investor or trader to declare your equity short term trades.

If you follow these simple rules, let me assure you – there is no need to fear the taxman.

Before we wrap this chapter, here are some interesting links that you should read through.
